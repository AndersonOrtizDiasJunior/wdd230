            According to the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/visual-hierarchy">Interaction Design Foundation website</a> the definition of Visual Hierarchy is "the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance."<br> Netflix's page does this very usil using the font size a position of its texts. when you look to ther page, the first thing that captures your eyes is the phrase "Unlimited movies, TV shows and more." which gives the user a reason to sign their service, following the human sight natural flow there are another texts with another advantages of the streaming service.

            According to the <a href="https://lawsofux.com/hicks-law/">Laws of UX</a> website, the Hick's laws states that "The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices" and one of its takeaways is 
            to "Minimize choices when response times are critical to increase decision time."
            <br>
            YT1 is a website where you can download a YouTube video in a variety of formats using its url. Instead of giving a lot of complicated settings for the download, YT1 only exposes two very intuitive choices to the user: the file format on the superior tabs and the url in a big form with a bright red download button. Making thus the decision quick and simple.

                <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>

            According to the <a href="https://lawsofux.com/fittss-law/">Laws of UX</a> website, the Fitt's Law says that "The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target",
            or n other words, the smaller and farest a target is, the hardest is to the hit it.<br>
           This applies to UX specially when we are talking about buttons and other touchable/clickable features.<br>
         Google's website uses this principle very well, since its type file is not only centered verticall, but also extends for almost the whole screen width, making it hard to missclick.
